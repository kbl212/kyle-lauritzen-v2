    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="about-me-contain">
        <p>I grew up on the East Coast, in New Haven, Connecticut. Growing up, I always loved using computers; while I was in my teens, it was mostly for gaming, I'll admit. I had several friends who were super into programming, and would teach themselves how to code; crazy, I thought. I took a CS course in high school with a friend, which I enjoyed, but frankly didn't understand it too well at the time.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.byu.edu"><img id='byu-logo' src="../byu-stretch-y-logo.jpg"></a>While at BYU, I had a roommate who was a web developer. He showed me some of his projects he was working on, and told me how everything these days was starting to shift to the web. As I did a bit more research, I realized just how true that statement was. So I started to teach myself the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>   <p><a href="http://www.devmounta.in"><img id="dev-mtn-logo" src="../devMtn-logo.png"></a> After a few months, I looked into places where I could learn a lot more in-depth about web development. That's when I stumbled upon DevMountain. I applied, got in, graduated, and am currently working as a Front-End Web Developer for a small contracting company called <a href="http://tagvar.com">TagVar</a></p>
        <p>Apart from coding, I've always been super into fitness; I was on my high school's cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track teams. Now, I can't say I'm much of a runner, but I've experimented with several different workout regimens, including Insanity, Athlean-X, and currently a modified 5-3-1 weightlifting program.</p>
